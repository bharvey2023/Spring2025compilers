# LITTLE Language Compiler

**Spring 2025 Term Project** â€“ Developed by [Your Name] and team  

This project is a multi-stage compiler for the **LITTLE programming language**, focused on basic math operations. The compiler was built using **ANTLR v4** and Java, emphasizing modularity, team collaboration, and optimization.

## Overview
- Created the **grammar file** for parsing LITTLE programs.
- Implemented a **tokenizer and parser** using ANTLR.
- Generated **intermediate code** for arithmetic operations.
- Applied **basic optimizations**, including constant folding.
- Managed **symbol tables and scope tracking** for variables.
- Focused on **code efficiency and readability**, with teamwork in a Git version-controlled environment.

## Skills & Tools
- **Languages:** Java  
- **Tools:** ANTLR v4, Git  
- **Concepts:** Compiler design, parsing, code generation, optimizations, symbol tables  

## How to Run
1. Clone or extract the project ZIP.  
2. Compile Java files.  
3. Run the compiler on a LITTLE language source file.  
4. Observe tokenization, parsing, and intermediate code output.
