#COMPILER README

Collaborated with my team to build a multi-stage compiler for the LITTLE programming language using ANTLR v4. Focused on designing the grammar file and optimizing code generation for basic mathematical operations. Gained hands-on experience debugging parsing logic, managing symbol tables, and turning abstract language rules into working codeâ€”all while learning to make our compiler efficient and reliable.
